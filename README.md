# FEUP-CGRA
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Computer Graphics course.

The course focuses in computer graphics concepts using the WebCGF library based in WebGL.

All projects should be run using a web server. One way to do this is to start a python web server in the folder that we want to execute:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Exercises

- **TP1:** Setup and library basics
- **TP2:** Geometry and Transformations
- **TP3:** Lighting and Materials
- **TP4:** Textures
- **TP5:** Shaders
- **TP6:** Procedural Modeling
