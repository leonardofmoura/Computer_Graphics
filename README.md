# FEUP-CGRA
Repository created to host projects elaborated in the Computer Graphics course.

The course focuses in computer graphics concepts using the WebCGF library based in WebGL.

All projects/exercises should be run using a web server. One way to do this is to start a python web server in the folder that we want to execute:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

The server will be available on `localhost:8080`

## Exercises 

Exercises solved to gain some practical insight on Computer Graphics basics. They are divided in Theoretical-Practical (TP) classes.

- **TP1:** Setup and library basics
- **TP2:** Geometry and Transformations
- **TP3:** Lighting and Materials
- **TP4:** Textures
- **TP5:** Shaders
- **TP6:** Procedural Modeling

## Projects

Projects developed to apply Computer Graphics concepts on a bigger scale. They were developed with my partner [João Araújo](https://github.com/jfcaraujo) and the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jfcaraujo/CGRA-PROJ).

- **Project 1:** Complex scene with different geometries, materials, textures and lighting.
- **Project 2:** Interactive scene with animations, terrain using heightmaps, and procedural modeling.
